QUESTION 1: Which values of width, height, and icount did you select for your machine to generate a Mandelbrot image with 1 thread with around a 30 second runtime: 
    width = 2000  height = 2000  icount = 300

QUESTION 2: Provide the output of ``time ./mandelbrot `` *width height icount nthreads* for runs with 1 through 16 threads below. You can run all of these with a single bash command if you like: ``for i in {1..16} ; do time ./mandelbrot 2000 2000 500 $i ; done``

QUESTION 3: Does adding more threads continue to speed up the program? Do more threads ever slow down the program slightly?  Why or why not?

    Adding more threads continue to speed up the program because it can calculate more rows at the same time.


QUESTION 4: Does adding more threads increase the "system load", or is it constant regardless of the number of threads?  Why?

    Yes. It increases the "system load" because it has to execute many thread at the same time.
